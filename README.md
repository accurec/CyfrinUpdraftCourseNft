## About

This is just a not very polished project to explore how to create and store NFTs using Openzeppelin library, IPFS and SVG data.
In `SelectorDirectCalls.sol` file there is some exploration on how to call functions with data directly on smart contracts. Also exploring a bit of `cast sig` command to verify Metamask calls as well as `cast --calldata-decode` to decode the called data for the transaction.
